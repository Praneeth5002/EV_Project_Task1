In recent years, the electric vehicle (EV) industry has witnessed significant technological advancement and global adoption. However, potential buyers and enthusiasts often find it difficult to access accurate, consolidated, and comprehensible information about EV models, specifications, and performance metrics. Most existing information sources—such as websites and comparison tools—are static, lack personalization, and do not support interactive query resolution.

To address this gap, this project aims to design and develop a Generative AI-powered chatbot that utilizes the Electric Vehicle Specifications Dataset (2025) to provide dynamic, conversational access to EV data. The chatbot will interpret natural language queries, retrieve relevant information from the dataset, and generate human-like responses to questions such as “Which EV has the highest range under ₹30 lakhs?” or “Compare the Tata Nexon EV and MG ZS EV.” This solution will make EV information more accessible, engaging, and user-centric.
