🧩 Problem Statement

In recent years, the electric vehicle (EV) industry has witnessed significant technological advancement and global adoption. However, potential buyers and enthusiasts often find it difficult to access accurate, consolidated, and comprehensible information about EV models, specifications, and performance metrics. Most existing information sources—such as websites and comparison tools—are static, lack personalization, and do not support interactive query resolution.

To address this gap, this project aims to design and develop a Generative AI-powered chatbot that utilizes the Electric Vehicle Specifications Dataset (2025) to provide dynamic, conversational access to EV data. The chatbot will interpret natural language queries, retrieve relevant information from the dataset, and generate human-like responses to questions such as “Which EV has the highest range under ₹30 lakhs?” or “Compare the Tata Nexon EV and MG ZS EV.” This solution will make EV information more accessible, engaging, and user-centric.

🎯 Objectives

To design a conversational chatbot capable of understanding natural language queries about electric vehicles.
To integrate and preprocess the Electric Vehicle Specs Dataset (2025) for efficient retrieval of model data.
To implement data filtering and comparison logic for price, range, battery capacity, and performance parameters.
To use Generative AI (LLMs) for producing human-like, context-aware responses.
To enable EV recommendation and comparison features through interactive chat-based responses.
To evaluate the chatbot’s accuracy, user satisfaction, and response quality through testing and feedback.

🧠 Expected Outcome

A fully functional chatbot that can interactively answer EV-related questions in natural language.
Accurate data retrieval and comparison using the Electric Vehicle Specs dataset.
Enhanced user experience through AI-generated conversational responses.
A scalable framework that can be extended with live EV data and charging station APIs.
